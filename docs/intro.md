# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Course

Welcome to the comprehensive course on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics! This course provides a complete educational journey from the foundational concepts of robotic systems to advanced AI integration for autonomous humanoid behavior.

## Course Overview

This course is structured into four comprehensive modules that progressively build your understanding of physical AI systems:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
Learn about Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) as the middleware layer that enables embodied intelligence and humanoid robot control. This module covers:
- ROS 2 architecture and communication patterns
- Integration of AI agents with robotic systems
- URDF modeling for humanoid robots

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
Explore digital twin environments using Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for high-fidelity rendering. This module includes:
- Physics-based simulation with realistic dynamics
- High-fidelity visual rendering and human-robot interaction
- Simulated perception systems for sensor data generation

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
Discover NVIDIA Isaac as the AI brain that enables perception, learning, and navigation through photorealistic simulation and hardware-accelerated pipelines. This module covers:
- Isaac Sim for intelligent perception and synthetic data generation
- Isaac ROS for accelerated robotics and navigation
- From perception to action systems integration

### Module 4: Vision–Language–Action (VLA)
Master the integration of vision, language, and action for complete autonomous behavior. This module includes:
- Voice and language interfaces for robot control
- Cognitive planning with large language models (LLMs)
- Capstone: Autonomous humanoid implementation

## Getting Started
